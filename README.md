I have build a simple Notes app project to demonstrate full-stack development in Python with FastAPI and React.js
The Notes app itself is a Single Page App (SPA) built with React.js that connects to the RESTful API made with FastAPI. 
This RESTful API handles the connection to the database and manages the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation.




The Tech Stack
React.js - a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, providing an efficient and declarative way to create interactive components for web applications.

FastAPI - a modern, high-performance Python web framework that makes it easy to build robust APIs with minimal code and maximum efficiency.

SQLite - a lightweight, embedded relational database management system that provides a self-contained, serverless, and file-based solution for storing and retrieving structured data.
